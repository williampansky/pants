I had the pleasure of working with William for 3 years... he can wear as many hats as I've ever seen. He's a fountain of creative ideas, a cutting edge front end web developer and a talented and thoughtful graphic designer.

He also adds significant value to every meeting and client interaction he attends. He doesn't mind taking redirection, and will work like a horse until the job is done and the client/account manager are both happy. The guy is a rock star, hope to work with him again.
