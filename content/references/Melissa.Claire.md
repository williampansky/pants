William Pansky really helped my business progress from one stage to another by picking up the pieces when another designer fell through. He was able to take their drafts, make them his own, and turn out a wonderful product that really captured the feel of my business and easily related it to my clients. Additionally, he did a fantastic job assembling/designing my significant other’s business website, SpurrierMusic.com.
