William has been with Sabre for coming up on two years. During that time we've had some chaos and change with reorganizations and different leaders _(who brought varying leadership styles)_. But you'd never know any of that was going on in the background if your only interactions were with William. He keeps his eye on the end goal and works until he achieves it.

While there are many good front-end developers around, William is also a delight to speak or chat with, bringing a fun and engaging personality to the team along with his solid developer skill set. I haven't worked with him in a design capacity, but I know that's an area he excels in as well, which is rare to find someone with such a balanced left and right brain approach to websites. Definitely a solid teammate all around!
