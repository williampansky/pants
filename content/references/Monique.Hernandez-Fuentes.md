William Pansky is an excellent graphic designer. Over the years that I have known him, he has always pushed the envelope with his creativity and ingenuity; his "can-do" attitude is always appreciated. I would recommend him to anyone I know looking for great design and will always seek his advice because I know it will be solid.
