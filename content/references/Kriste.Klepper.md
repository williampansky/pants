As Vice President of Marketing for Goodwill Industries of Dallas, William was the direct creative staff member from the Miller Ad Agency, that I worked with to have the Goodwill web site completely redesigned.

He was a pleasure to work with on this project. I am not a web designer and William was able to really give us great service. He worked on the re-development of this site and met all deadlines, offered creative options and really cared about designing something that would work for Goodwill.

The site turned out great and William was always available to make little adjustments or tweaks when we need changes. I highly recommend Willam for any web site project you may have.
