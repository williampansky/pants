Miller Ad Agency was looking for a creative person who can do more than just graphic design, a person who can morph into a web designer or front-end developer when required. When I interviewed William little over 3 years ago my immediate reaction was: _“I gotta have him”_.

With the experience that he brought to the table, he immediately made our team better. His work ethics are second to none. The best abilities he possesses are his personality, ability to manage multiple jobs, and strong will to switch to a different type of work in a moment’s notice. I call William a one-man-army. I can’t wait to work with him again.
