I had the pleasure of working as William's team lead on a new project at Sabre. Throughout the design and initial planning phases, William's attention to detail from both a user experience as well as a user interface design perspective was invaluable.

He consistently advocates for users in development conversations, and has an eye for aesthetic design, security, resilient app design and vertical app integration that improve the results for the entire team. On top of this, in the actual collaborative development of web-based solutions, his code is concise, extremely functional, and to-spec from the outset. 

Outside of his technical skills, William is an affable and collaborative team member - his positivity contributes to team morale, and he gets along easily with other team members, mentoring where necessary and pairing well with a variety of skillsets to produce excellent work. It was a pleasure working with William, and I would strongly recommend hiring him.
