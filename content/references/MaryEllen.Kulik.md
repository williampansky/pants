William is very proactive at asking questions and delivering a fresh perspective on projects he is given. He is also comfortable sharing his opinion with account managers, such as myself, and is great about initiating face-to-face communication, instead of email, to make sure that no information is misinterpreted.

Overall, William is one of the best creatives I have worked with. Innovative and thoughtful, mindful of timelines and budgets - he delivers superior creative that is consistently on strategy. He exudes creativity and can wear multiple hats. William is an amazing creative asset!
