[Miller Ad Agency](http://milleradagency.com), since 1984, has, _"...earned a reputation as experts in digital and traditional advertising-"_ as a full-service suite; everything from account execs to video editors, from media buyers to creatives (that's where I fit in here).

Let's just, like, plop in some of my resume bulletpoints here and move on with our lives. I know no one's reading this. And if you are reading this... well, find better uses for your time - I _urge_ you. Please? Kthx.

#### My roles
My part revolved around the website. Everything from structure to wireframing to conceptual mockups to production assets to HTML and vanilla CSS (not discovering Sass until well after this projectâ€™s completion).

If you're interested in browsing around the pre-redesign version of the website, you can head on over to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20140110155931/http://goodwilldallas.org/).
