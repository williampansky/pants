Collaboration with the same crew of [Estranged](http://williampansky.com/portfolio/estranged), I was once again commissioned to create key art for the group’s, named [17 Productions](https://www.facebook.com/17-productions-483227768524815/), next indie short film. [Serendipitax](https://www.facebook.com/Serendipitax/) is about Michael’s chance to recruit an inmate to his side, but his own psychological paranoia taxed his potential to save her.
