Shana Mcmillan approached me, thanks to a tip via our mutual friend [Krystal René](https://www.facebook.com/krystalrenephotography/) with an opportunity to go wild and create some really interesting and visually exciting t-shirt designs. [Respect My Pretty](https://www.respectmypretty.com) is the movement _"...of girls, women demanding respect for our individuality as well as embracing the individuality of others-"_ and Shana really wanted to have that driven home in the art.
