      <description>Introduction The Lunch, Goodwill Industries of Dallas&#39; annual fundraising event, found wonderful success for its first two years – securing over $1.5m each year to, “... expand and enhance job training services.”
 For 2017, I suggested a revamp of how to present the event and guest speaker information to visitors and donors that would match the high level of importance that Goodwill Dallas places on the event. Prior year information was housed in a subpage of goodwilldallas.</description>
