      <description>Introduction The Lunch, Goodwill Industries of Dallas&#39; annual fundraising event, found wonderful success for its first two years – securing over $1.5m each year to, “... expand and enhance job training services.”
 For 2017, I suggested a revamp of how to present the event and guest speaker information to visitors and donors that would match the high level of importance that Goodwill Dallas places on the event. Prior year information was housed in a subpage of goodwilldallas.</description>

      <description> Shana Mcmillan approached me, thanks to a tip via our mutual friend Krystal René with an opportunity to go wild and create some really interesting and visually exciting t-shirt designs. Respect My Pretty is the movement &amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;of girls, women demanding respect for our individuality as well as embracing the individuality of others-&amp;rdquo; and Shana really wanted to have that driven home in the art.

      <description>Introduction Over the course of my third year at Miller Ad Agency I became increasingly infatuated with front-end web development.
I learned as much as I could, I dreamt about UI and UX before falling asleep, I carved out a (basically) web-only position for myself; if it were possible to eat web dev – I&amp;rsquo;d have probably done that too.
My awesome art director and good friend, Sasha Gelemanovic, knew he needed a way to keep me interested in the day-to-day workload.</description>
